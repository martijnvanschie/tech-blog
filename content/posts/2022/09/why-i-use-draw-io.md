I'm getting a lot of questions lately from people asking me what tool(s) i use to create my diagrams. You will be surprised that this is actually a free tool which is accessible to everyone.

{{< admonition note "Disclaimer" >}}
Please note that this is my personal opinion. There are many tools out there and some might have the same features a this one. I did not test all other tools.

# My history in creating diagrams

## Why diagram

Diagrams, we see them all the time. Schematic representations of a topic or solution with beautiful boxes, lines, arrows and icons. 

For me, diagrams are a real added value to any kind of documentation or presentation. They help to tell the story, clear out the textual part of a solution and are really handy to use in meetings (point and click). 

For instance, a piece of text in a solution design can be detailed with the addition of a diagram. On the other hand, it's also hard to create a diagram which is fully self-explanatory. Therefore a diagram is often accompanied by a piece of text to explain what is meant.

## Types of diagrams

I've been using a lot of different tools throughout the years. Some where payed licensed tools and some where freeware. In this blog will walk you tough some of the main tools and what i used them for but in the end the focus is mostly on `diagram.net`.

### Unified Modeling Language (UML)

When i started working as a lead developer / software architect is was mainly focussed on creating architecture designs for individual applications or sometimes small solutions (some front-end with a backend and a database). This would involve drawing application diagrams  with components, classes and interface, data models and some sequence diagrams.

Initially i started out using `Visio` for this. This was the GoTo tool at that time and because we had access to the microsoft tooling this was an obvious choice.

Back in the days of Visual Studio 2010 (something like that) there was an option to use the class designer and create some basic class diagrams. You could also generate the diagram based on the code in the project, which was actually pretty handy sometimes. THe problem with this tool was the lack of reusability. Classes

### What is missing

Reusability, only one templates option. Would like to have more.

Project structure, don't really like the tabs
