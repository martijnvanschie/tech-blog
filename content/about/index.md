My name is Martijn van Schie and I'm an Azure Solution Architect at [Bryte Blue](https://bryte.blue).

I have over 15 years of experience with both on-premise and cloud solutions and architecture patterns.

This blog is my way of sharing experience on everything that is related to Azure Cloud and Services. Everyone has a different view on how they would address specific challenges and it's good to share this with the community.
