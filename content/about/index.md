My name is Martijn van Schie and I'm an Azure Enthusiast working as a at [Macaw](https://www.macaw.nl).

I have over 18 years of experience with both on-premises and cloud solutions and architecture patterns.

This blog is my way of sharing experience on everything that is related to Azure Cloud and Services. Everyone has a different view on how they would address specific challenges and it's good to share this with the community.
